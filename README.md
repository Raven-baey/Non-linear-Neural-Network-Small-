# 🌊 Non-linear Neural Network Small

A small Python project that trains a neural network to learn a non-linear function (sine with noise).  

---

## ✨ Description

This script generates a non-linear dataset based on the sine function with noise and trains a simple **feedforward neural network** to learn the relationship. The results are visualized in a plot.

---

## 🛠️ Requirements

- Python 3.x
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
- [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)

Install the required packages with:

```bash
pip install numpy tensorflow matplotlib
🚀 Usage
Run the script:

bash
Copy code
python Neural\ Network.py
After training, a plot will show:

🔵 Original data

🔴 Model predictions

🧩 Features
Generates non-linear data (y = sin(x) + noise)

Builds a small neural network with two hidden layers

Visualizes the data and predictions
